		Welcome to the Make_Me Application.  I know I have created a ton of "to list" over the years:
			<ul>
				<li>Recipes that I want to try</li>
				<li>Resturants that I should go to</li>
				<li>My Bucket List</li>
				<li>Places to see</li>
			</ul>
		These lists keep growing and growing and I rarely check it out when I am looking for something to do. It is just too daunting.  Make_Me is an application to take the decision out of your hands.
		Select a category and we will tell you what to do.  That's it, go do it.
		(can't?)
		Well, we let you skip doing something up to <strong>three</strong> times, no more.  If you skip it more than three times, you probably really don't want to do it.
